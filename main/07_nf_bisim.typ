= Normal Form Bisimulations <ch-nf-bisim>

Operational game semantics is intimately linked to another slightly older
family of coinductive constructions: normal form bisimulations. Stemming from
work on program equivalence, normal form bisimulation #peio[who coined it?] is
an umbrella term for the equivalences induced by several related
constructions such as #nm[BÃ¶hm] trees, #nm[Levy]-#nm[Longo] trees, #nm[Lassen]
trees, and other constructions tailored to a variety of settings #peio[ref]. In
this short chapter, we start by introducing our own variant of normal form
bisimulation, for any given language machine (@sec-nf-bisim). Then, in
@sec-nf-ogs we show how the interpretation from language configurations to OGS
strategies can be factorized through _normal form strategies_. Thanks to this,
we deduce a correctness theorem, stating---as for OGS---that any two _normal
form bisimilar_ language configurations are _substitution equivalent_.

#remark[
  Be advised that at the time of writing these lines, the constructions and
  proofs contained in this chapter are only sketched in the Coq artifact. As
  we will see the proofs are not particularly challenging, but this part
  came in quite late during the thesis. I invite you to check the

== Normal Form Bisimulations in a Nutshell <sec-nf-bisim>

Implicitly or explicitly, the main idea in all normal form (NF) bisimulations
constructions, is to associate to each program a possibly infinite tree. Here,
we will call these trees _normal form strategies_, that is, strategies for the
_normal form game_. This induces a notion of program equivalence which holds
whenever two programs have bisimilar associated strategies: _normal form
bisimilarity_.

These infinite trees are constructed by reducing the program to a normal form
for some given reduction strategy---most usually some kind of head-reduction.
The "head" of the normal form gives us the node of the tree, while the children
are obtained by coinductively applying the same process to the subterms of the
normal form. By now this process of splitting a normal forms into a head and a
sequence of subterms should ring a bell... Although OGS and NF bisimulations
have historically been introduced in reverse order, we can use our readily
available knowledge of the OGS game to provide a very succinct and precise
description of the normal form game. The NF game is nothing else than a
restriction of the OGS game, where the server is only allowed to query the
variables introduced by the last client move.

Reusing our existing infrastructure of binding families and named observations,
we express the NF game quite similarly to the OGS game, simply changing the
game positions and transition functions. Since the allowed server moves are
dictated by the _last_ client move, only the client scope needs to be threaded
throughout the game positions. As such, client positions consist of a single scope
$Gamma$, containing the variables the client is allowed to observe, while
server positions consist of two scopes $(Gamma, Delta)$, containing the
variables that respectively the server and the client are allowed to observe.

#definition[NF Game][
  Assuming a scope structure $ctx.scope_T th S$, given a binding family $O cl
  ctx.bfam_T th S$, the _normal form (NF) game_ is defined as follows.

  $ nf.g cl game.g th S th (S base.prod S) kw.whr \
    pat(game.client := \
          pat(game.mv th Gamma := O^ctx.named th Gamma,
              game.nx th {Gamma} th o := (ctx.domnm th o, Gamma)),
        game.server := \
          pat(game.mv th (Gamma, Delta) := O^ctx.named th Gamma,
              game.nx th {Gamma, Delta} th o := Delta ctx.cat ctx.domnm th o),
       ) $
]

We then define active and passive normal form strategies with respect to a
final scope $Omega$, as for OGS strategies.

#definition[NF Strategies][
  Assuming a scope structure $ctx.scope_T th S$, given a binding family $O cl
  ctx.bfam_T th S$ and a scope $Omega cl S$, _active and passive normal form
  strategies over $O$ with final scope $Omega$_ are defined as follows.

  $ nf.stratA th Omega th Gamma := game.stratA_nf.g th (kw.fun th Gamma |-> O^ctx.named th Omega) th Gamma \
    nf.stratP th Omega th Gamma th Delta := game.stratP_nf.g th (kw.fun th Gamma |-> O^ctx.named th Omega) th (Gamma, Delta) $
]

#remark[
  Note that $nf.stratP th Omega$ is isomorphic to an assignment type. Indeed,
  define "unary" passive strategies as follows.

  $ de("NF"^1_bk(O)) th Omega cl base.Type^(S,T) \
    de("NF"^1_bk(O)) th Omega th Gamma th alpha := (o cl O.ctx.Oper th alpha) -> nf.stratA th Omega th (Gamma ctx.cat O.ctx.dom o) $

  Then, $nf.stratP th Omega th Gamma th Delta$ is isomorphic to $Gamma
  asgn(de("NF"^1_bk(O)) th Omega th) Delta$, as witnessed by the following two
  conversion functions, definitionally inverse to each other.

  $ & de("into") th s^- th i th o && := s^- th (i ctx.cute o) \
    & de("from") th sigma th (i ctx.cute o) && := sigma th i th o $

  In light of this, we will extend standard assignment notations to passive strategies,
  in particular the terminal arrow and the copairing.

  #mathpar(block: true, spacing: 2em,
    $ [] cl nf.stratP th Omega th ctx.emp th Delta \
      [] := de("from") th [] $,
    $ [k_1, k_2] cl nf.stratP th Omega th (Gamma_1 ctx.cat Gamma_2) th Delta \
      [k_1, k_2] := de("from") th [de("into") th k_1, de("into") th k_2] $)
] <rem-nf-unary>

Given a language machine with renamings, we now construct the strategy associated to
any given language configuration. Once again, it is merely a simplified version of
the OGS machine strategy: it proceeds by evaluating the current language configuration
to compute the next move, and using the application map to respond to queries.

#definition[NF Strategy][
  Given a language machine $M cl ogs.machine th O th V th C$ with renamings,
  i.e., such that $sub.pren th V$ and $sub.ren th C$ hold, given a final scope
  $Omega cl S$, the _NF machine strategy_ is the big-step system defined as follows.
  $ nf.mstrat th M cl strat.bs_nf.g th (kw.fun th Gamma |-> O^ctx.named th Omega) \
    nf.mstrat th M := \
    pat(
      strat.stp th Gamma := C th (Omega ctx.cat Gamma),
      strat.stn th (Gamma, Delta) := Gamma asgn(V) (Omega ctx.cat Delta),
      strat.play th c := kw.do \
        quad ((i ctx.cute o), gamma) <- ogs.eval th c th ";" \
        quad kw.case (ctx.vcat th i) \
        quad pat(
          ctx.vcatl th i & := itree.ret th (base.inj1 th (i ctx.cute o)),
          ctx.vcatr th j & := itree.ret th (base.inj2 th ((j ctx.cute o), gamma)),
        ),
      strat.coplay th gamma th (i ctx.cute o) :=
        ogs.apply th (gamma th i)[rho_1] th o th rho_2 ,
    ) \
    \
    rho_1 := [ctx.rcatl, ctx.rcatr[ctx.rcatl]] \
    rho_2 := ctx.rcatr[ctx.rcatr] $
] <def-nf-mstrat>

#definition[NF Interpretation, NF Bisimulation][
  Given a language machine $M cl ogs.machine th O th V th C$ with renamings,
  i.e., such that $sub.pren th V$ and $sub.ren th C$ hold, given a final
  scope $Omega cl S$, the _NF interpretation_ is obtained
  by unrolling the NF machine strategy.

  $ nfinterpA(ar) th {Gamma} cl C th Gamma -> nf.stratA th Omega th Gamma \
    nfinterpA(c) := itree.unrollA_(nf.mstrat th M) th c[ctx.rcatr] $

  Furthermore, two configurations $c_1, c_2 cl C th Gamma$ are _normal form bisimilar_
  whenever $nfinterpA(c_1) itree.weq nfinterpA(c_2)$.
] <def-nf-bisim>

== NF Correctness through OGS <sec-nf-ogs>

To deduce correctness of NF bisimulation from our OGS correctness theorem, we
need to relate NF strategies and OGS strategies. First, since the NF game
is very close to the OGS game, simply allowing less server moves, it is easy
to restrict an OGS strategy to an NF strategy.

#definition[OGS to NF][
  Assuming a scope structure $ctx.scope_T th S$, given a binding family $O cl
  ctx.bfam_T th S$ and a scope $Omega cl S$, define the _restriction from OGS
  to NF strategies_ by coinduction as follows.

  $ nf.ogs2nfA th {Psi} cl ogs.stratA th Omega th Psi -> nf.stratA th Omega th (ogs.catE Psi) \
    nf.ogs2nfA th s := \
    pat(itree.obs := kw.case s .itree.obs \
      pat(itree.retF th r & := itree.retF th r,
          itree.tauF th t & := itree.tauF th (nf.ogs2nfA th t),
          itree.visF th q th k & := itree.visF th q th (kw.fun th (i ctx.cute o) |-> nf.ogs2nfA th (k th (ctx.rcatr th i ctx.cute o))))) \
    $
]

Yet the most interesting direction is the other one: embedding NF strategies into OGS
strategies. In the OGS game, the server is also allowed to query older variables, which,
on the face of it, an NF strategy does not know how to respond to. However, every variable
was once new! So if we remember all the continuations of an NF strategy along the way,
we can accumulate enough information to respond to any OGS server queries, by restarting
the relevant old continuation. In order to do so, we will first need a small helper to
weaken the scope of NF strategies.

#definition[NF Strategy Renaming][
  Assuming a scope structure $ctx.scope_T th S$, given a binding family $O cl
  ctx.bfam_T th S$ and a scope $Omega cl S$, define the _active and passive NF strategy
  renamings_ by mutual coinduction as follows.
  #margin-note[This is in fact the definition the action of two renaming
  structures, on $nf.stratA th Omega$ and $nf.stratP th Omega th Gamma$.]

  $ //nf.renA th {Omega th Gamma_1 th Gamma_2} cl nf.stratA th Omega th Gamma_1 -> Gamma_1 ctx.ren Gamma_2 -> nf.stratA th Omega th Gamma_2 \
    nf.renA th {Omega} cl nf.stratA th Omega ctx.arr ctxhom((ctx.var), nf.stratA th Omega) \
    nf.renA th s th rho := \
    pat(itree.obs := kw.case s .itree.obs \
        pat(itree.retF th r & := itree.retF th r,
            itree.tauF th t & := itree.tauF th (nf.renA th t th rho),
            itree.visF th (i ctx.cute o) th k & := itree.visF th (rho th i ctx.cute o) th (nf.renP th k th rho))
    ) \
    \
    nf.renP th {Omega th Gamma} cl nf.stratP th Omega th Gamma ctx.arr ctxhom((ctx.var), nf.stratP th Omega th Gamma) \
    nf.renP th k th rho th m := nf.renA th (k th m) th [rho dot ctx.rcatl, ctx.rcatr] $
] <def-nf-ren>

#definition[NF to OGS][
  Assuming a scope structure $ctx.scope_T th S$, given a binding family $O cl
  ctx.bfam_T th S$ and a scope $Omega cl S$, define as follows the _active and
  passive embedding from NF strategies to OGS strategies_.

  $ nf.nf2ogsA th {Omega th Psi} cl nf.stratA th Omega th (ogs.catE Psi) -> nf.stratP th Omega th (ogs.catO Psi) th (ogs.catE Psi) -> ogs.stratA th Omega th Psi \
    nf.nf2ogsA th s th italic("ks") := \
    pat(itree.obs := kw.case th s.itree.obs \
      pat(itree.retF th r & := itree.retF r,
          itree.tauF th t & := itree.tauF th (nf.nf2ogsA th t th italic("ks")),
          itree.visF th m th k & := itree.visF th m th (nf.nf2ogsP th [italic("ks"), k]))
    ) \
    \
    nf.nf2ogsP th {Omega th Psi} cl nf.stratP th Omega th (ogs.catE Psi) th (ogs.catO Psi) -> ogs.stratP th Omega th Psi \
    nf.nf2ogsP th italic("ks") th m := nf.nf2ogsA th (italic("ks") th m) th (nf.renP th italic("ks") th ctx.rcatr) $

  Finally, define the following shorthand, embedding NF strategies to OGS strategies over an
  initial position.

  $ nf.nf2ogs th {Omega th Gamma} cl nf.stratA th Omega th Gamma -> ogs.stratA th Omega th (ctx.nilc ctx.conc Gamma) \
    nf.nf2ogs th s := nf.nf2ogsA th s th [] $
] <def-nf-to-ogs>

We can now show that the OGS interpretation can be factorized through the NF
interpretation. However, because the coinductive call of $nf.nf2ogsP$ is below
a call to the strategy renaming, renamings will creep up during the
bisimulation proof. For this reason we first need to prove an up-to-renaming
reasoning principle for NF strategies, essentially stating that any NF
bisimulation candidate is closed under renamings.

#lemma[NF Bisimulation Up-to Renaming][
  Assuming a scope structure $ctx.scope_T th S$, a binding family $O cl
  ctx.bfam_T th S$ and a scope $Omega cl S$, then $nf.renA th {Omega}$
  respects any member of the strong bisimulation tower and of
  the weak bisimulation tower, i.e., for any

  #box($ cal(C) in tower.t_(itree.sb_nf.g) quad quad "or" quad quad cal(C) in tower.t_(itree.wb_nf.g), $)

  the following property holds.

  $ nf.renA xrel(cal(C) th (cnorm(=)) rel.carr ctxhom((cnorm(=)), cal(C) th (cnorm(=)))^de(rel.r)) nf.renA $
] <lem-nf-ren-mono>
#proof[
  Both statements (weak and strong) are proven by direct tower induction.
]
#remark[
  Recalling @lem-tower-fix, the above lemma implies in particular that
  $nf.renA$ respects both weak and strong bisimilarity.
]

#theorem[OGS Through NF Factorization][
  Given a language machine $M cl ogs.machine th O th V th C$ with renamings
  and a final
  scope $Omega cl S$, the OGS interpretation factorizes through the NF interpretation.
  More precisely, for any $c cl C th Gamma$, the following property holds.

  $ ogsinterpA(c) game.eqA nf.nf2ogs th (nfinterpA(c)) $
] <thm-ogs-nf-facto>
#proof[
  The only trick required to prove this is to generalize the statement to arbitrary OGS
  game positions and machine strategy states. We prove that for any $Psi cl
  ctx.ctxc th S$, $c' cl C th (Omega ctx.cat ogs.catE Psi)$ and $e cl
  ogs.teleA th Psi$ the following property holds.

  $ & itree.unrollA_(ogs.mstrat th M) th (c' ctx.cute e) \
    game.eqA & nf.nf2ogsA th (itree.unrollA_(nf.mstrat th M) th c') th (itree.unrollP_(nf.mstrat th M) th (ogs.collA e)) $

  This statement is then proven by direct coinduction, unfolding the
  definitions and using @lem-nf-ren-mono where required. The theorem follows
  by direct application, taking $Psi := ctx.nilc ctx.conc Gamma$, $c' :=
  c[ctx.rcatr]$ and $e := []$.
]

In order to finally prove NF bisimulation correctness, we still need to show a technicality,
namely that $nf.nf2ogs$ respects to weak bisimilarity.

#lemma[$nf.nf2ogs$ Respects Weak Bisimilarity][
  Assuming a scope structure $ctx.scope_T th S$, a binding family $O cl
  ctx.bfam_T th S$, $nf.nf2ogs$ respects weak bisimilarity, i.e.,
  the following property holds.

  $ nf.nf2ogs xrel(cnorm(itree.weq) rel.arr cnorm(itree.weq)) nf.nf2ogs $
] <lem-nf-mono>
#proof[
  We generalize the statement and show monotonicity of $nf.nf2ogsA$:
  #let ks1 = $italic("ks"_1)$
  #let ks2 = $italic("ks"_2)$

  $ nf.nf2ogsA xrel(cnorm(game.weqA) rel.arr cnorm(game.weqP) rel.arr cnorm(game.weqA)) nf.nf2ogsA. $

  This statement is proven by straightforward coinduction, using @lem-nf-ren-mono where required.
]

We can now prove the normal form bisimulation correctness theorem.

#theorem[NF Correctness][
  Assuming the same set of hypotheses as OGS correctness (@thm-correctness), NF bisimulation
  is correct w.r.t. substitution equivalence, i.e., for any $Gamma cl S$ and $c_1, c_2 cl C th Gamma$, the
  following statement holds.

  $ nfinterpA(c_1) game.weqA nfinterpA(c_2) -> c_1 ogs.subeq c_2 $
] <thm-nf-correctness>
#proof[
  Assume $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $nfinterpA(c_1) game.weqA nfinterpA(c_2)$. By @thm-correctness
  it is sufficient to prove $ogsinterpA(c_1) game.weqA ogsinterpA(c_2)$.

  $ ogsinterpA(c_1) th th & game.eqA nf.nf2ogs th (nfinterpA(c_1)) quad quad quad & #[(@thm-ogs-nf-facto)] \
                    & game.weqA nf.nf2ogs th (nfinterpA(c_2)) & #[(@lem-nf-mono)] \
                    & game.eqA ogsinterpA(c_2) & #[(@thm-ogs-nf-facto)] $
  #v(-2em)
]

The above correctness theorem concludes the treatment of normal form
bisimulations for this thesis. There is definitely a number of side results on
NF strategies which we have glossed over, such as, among others, the
injectivity of $nf.nf2ogs$. There is also much more to say on the relationship
between the NF game and the OGS game, but we leave this thorough study for
future work.

Since the server is allowed less moves in the NF game than in the OGS game, it
is naturally easier to prove that two language configurations are normal form
bisimilar than OGS bisimilar. As such, to prove substitution equivalence of two
concrete programs, the NF correctness theorem is of greater practical interest
than the OGS correctness theorem. In fact it can be argued that OGS is merely a
technical device for proving NF correctness, at least in the realm of program
equivalence for languages without state. And indeed, in a line of work by
#nm[Lassen] and #nm[Levy]~#mcite(dy: -1em, <LassenL07>)#mcite(dy: 2em,
<LassenL08>), an early appearance of an OGS-like construction can be
seen during the NF correctness proof.
