= Coinductive Game Strategies

As we have seen, Operational Game Semantics, and more generally interactive
semantics, rest upon a dialogue following particular rules, a so-called two
player game. The main task in this chapter will be to properly define what is
meant by a "game", "strategy", "transition system", and to provide basic
building blocks for manipulating them. This chapter thus takes a step back and
temporarly puts on hold our concerns about programming language semantics, in
order to introduce tools, to concretely represent games and strategies in type
theory. These tools are in part novel, but consist mostly of natural extensions
of pre-existing devices.

== A Matter of Computation

TODO: pas tr√®s satisfaisant; move this.

At heart, a strategy for a given two player game is an automaton of some kind,
in the loose sense that it has some internal state, a memory, and alternates
between two kinds of transitions, the ones where the strategy chooses a move to
play and the ones where it reacts to a move---any possible move---made by a
hypothetic opponent. In the classical literature on automata, but also in most
of the literature specifically dedicated to game semantics, these transitions
are typically modelled by _relations_ between input states, moves and output
states.

which in type theory would translate as
binary functions into the type of propositions. While perfectly doable, this
approach has a serious drawback: computability. In type theory, there is a very
clear distinction between a functional relation and an actual function. While
_some_ type theories do admit the principle of unique choice, enabling to build
a concrete function whose graph is a given functional relation,

== Describing Game Rules

Before talking about game _strategies_, we need to clarify what is meant by
game. In the common sense, games are described by the allowed moves at any
point of the game state, together with winning conditions and their associated
rewards. As I am here only interested in games insofar as they provide a
framework for structured interactions, usual notions such as "winning",
"reward" or "optimal play" will be completely absent. Moreover, I will restrict
my attention to games where two agents play in alternating fashion. As such,
for my purpose, games will just consist of the description of allowed moves and
the way they interact with a shared game state.

Such a retricted view on games---two player, alternating, no notion of
winning---might be more appropriately described as a _protocol_, as typically
arises when studying networking. At this point it is quite natural---for who is
familiar with the notion---to reach out to (indexed) polynomial functors.
Indeed they provide a readily available gadget with a rich theory, encoding a
variety of related notions: most usually inductive datatypes and algebraic
theories, but also client-server protocols (TODO ref scots). My journey started
there, but as we will see, it is not the end of the story. Indeed in the
context of encoding games, polynomial functors have a rather problematic
assymetry between the two players. To such an extent that it is impossible to
give a satisfying construction for something as simple as "swapping the two
player's roles" in a given game. In the solution I propose, polynomial functors
are still part of the final picture, but the starting point of the following
exposition is an intuitive understanding game moves.
